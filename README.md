# Bypassing a CGNAT with Wireguard

## Overview
Before switching ISPs, I had a public IP that allowed me to use port forwarding on my router to pass traffic to services hosted on my internal network.  My new ISP uses a CGNAT, so I had to find a workaround.  I chose this path, because it keeps pretty much everything the same for my services.  The main things I wanted to do with my setup were:
* Forward only specific traffic from the internet to my services
* Provide my NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) Server with clients real IPs (for fail2ban blocking purposes)
* Allow for traffic to flow to internal services that NPM doesn't manage

I went through a couple configurations and VPS providers before I created this solution.  Prior to attempting this, I had little to no knowledge about VPS providers, wireguard, ufw, and iptables.  Getting it to work the way I wanted took a few days of research, trial, and error.
This will hopefully be a useful tutorial for people who are in a similar situation.  
This tutorial assumes you have some basic knowledge about how to use Ubuntu from the command line.

Here is a basic diagram of my configuration.  The IPs and ports will need to be changed by you to meet your requirements.
